# scriptStuff
These are just some scripts I did for my personal use, for automating simple tasks, learning and testing things. Since most of them are very short, I guess it's better to put them all together in a single repository. There they are. 


## removeZips
Removes .zip files from a directory in which exists folders with the same name as the .zip files. It was originally written in Bash, and then also in Go.
